_In this series, I'll explore Ethereum from the ground up, assuming you have some programming knowledge to follow along._

Interestingly, I discovered that the underlying model powering Ethereum is deeply rooted in game theory—specifically, the Prisoner's Dilemma. Miners aim to maximize their payouts without considering the strategies of others. The true innovation of blockchain lies in its ability to incentivize cooperation among nodes in a distributed network, all without requiring trust between participants.

I’ve always wanted to deeply understand the model for smart contracts in a way that resonates with the authors’ aspirations for the technology. This curiosity led me to reach out to a friend with far more experience in the space he recommended I read white papers. It was during this exploration that I stumbled upon Ethereum’s Yellow Paper—a technical masterpiece. Much of what will be discussed here is derived from that foundational work.

## What is Ethereum?

According to the yellow paper:

<blockquote

>
  _Ethereum is a project which attempts to build the generalised technology;
  technology on which all transaction-based state machine concepts may be built.
  Moreover it aims to provide to the end-developer a tightly integrated
  end-to-end system for building software on a hitherto unexplored compute
  paradigm in the mainstream: a trustful object messaging compute framework._
</blockquote>

what does that mean?\
In my own opinion, it combines both a global state (singleton) and a VM (virtual machine).
