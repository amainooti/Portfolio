Recently a screenshot of my MacOS rice blew up on X (formerly Twitter), eventually becoming my most liked post of all time. In this post, I'll break down my setup and share the tools and configurations I use to achieve this minimal, productive environment.

## The Terminal Setup

At the heart of my setup is iTerm2 with a custom color scheme that matches my overall theme. I use the JetBrains Mono font for its excellent readability and ligature support.

## Window Management

For window management, I use Yabai, a tiling window manager for macOS. It allows me to control window placement and sizing with keyboard shortcuts, creating a more efficient workflow.

```bash
# Example Yabai configuration
yabai -m config layout bsp
yabai -m config window_placement second_child
yabai -m config split_ratio 0.50
```
