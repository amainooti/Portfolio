          <p>
            The landscape of software development is rapidly evolving with the integration of artificial intelligence. From code completion to automated testing, AI is transforming how we write and maintain code.
          </p>
          
          <h2>Code Generation and Assistance</h2>
          <p>
            Tools like GitHub Copilot and Amazon CodeWhisperer are revolutionizing how we write code. These AI assistants can suggest entire functions and help developers work more efficiently.
          </p>
          
          <h2>Automated Testing</h2>
          <p>
            AI is making significant strides in automated testing, helping developers identify potential bugs and edge cases that might be missed in traditional testing approaches.
          </p>
          
          <pre><code>
{`// Example of AI-generated test case
describe('UserAuthentication', () => {
  it('should handle invalid credentials', async () => {
    const result = await auth.login({
      username: 'test@example.com',
      password: 'invalidPassword'
    });
    expect(result.success).toBe(false);
    expect(result.error).toBe('Invalid credentials');
  });
});`}
          </code></pre>
          
          <h2>The Future Landscape</h2>
          <p>
            As AI continues to evolve, we can expect to see more sophisticated tools that not only assist in coding but also in architecture decisions and performance optimization.
